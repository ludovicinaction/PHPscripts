# PHPscripts
The "PHPscripts" includes a modules assembly (shown below) all configurable through the "back-office". 
This project is intended for all those who want to easily add functionality to a PHP website without a CMS and thus retain control over the code. 

PHP modules based on PHP5.5, MVC design pattern, Bootstrap and CKEditor

To date three modules are currently under development :

    - Ticket booking and payment (Paypal ExpressCheckout used)
    - Blogging.
    - Multilingual translation.
